                        Dear Diary,<br><br>
                        My 26th birthday trip was never supposed to happen. In fact, it existed for weeks purely as a chaotic idea inside a group call with Shashank, Dinesh, Aravind, and me — Raghavi, an idea that oscillated between "We're definitely doing this" and "Let's just cancel." Plans were made, scrapped, revived, and scrapped again with Olympic-level commitment. At one point, I was so convinced nothing would materialize that I booked a flight to India instead. I even made it all the way to the airport, boarding pass in hand, fully prepared for an entirely different birthday storyline — only to turn around and come back home. Somehow, in the most dramatic last-minute twist, the group call miracle happened and the trip came together. Against all odds, indecision, and geography, we actually made it.

                            And what a place it turned out to be. The Lake District felt almost unreal — like it had been carefully staged for maximum birthday drama. We saw a sky packed with stars so bright it didn't look natural, snow falling quietly at night, and by morning, the entire city resting under a soft white blanket. The mountains stood around us looking ancient and unbothered, as if they had seen many dramatic 26th birthdays before mine. Fighter jets suddenly streaked across the sky at one point, which felt unnecessarily cinematic but undeniably cool. We wandered into what seemed like an ancient cave, fully convinced we were about to uncover something historical (or at least mildly legendary). Evenings were reserved for the pub, where we had genuinely great dinners, celebratory champagne, and proper single malt whiskey.

                            But the true highlight of the trip — unquestionably — was Dinesh's unwavering commitment to losing at Cabo. He did not win a single game on the train ride there. He did not win a single game on the first day. On the second day, I believe he won exactly one game (I won six, of course). At one point, he and Arvind were tied one-all, and Arvind graciously suggested calling a truce. But Dinesh, despite overwhelming statistical evidence against him, declined. "How would you call me the king if we don't play the next game?" he asked with full confidence. Reader, he did not become king. He lost that game too. And honestly, nothing summarized the trip better than that — beautiful landscapes, good drinks, strong friendships, and Dinesh bravely defending a title he never quite earned.
